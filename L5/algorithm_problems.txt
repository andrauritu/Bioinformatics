The main problem with this DNA reconstruction algorithm is repetitive sequences. 

When DNA has the same pattern repeated multiple times, the algorithm gets confused about where each piece belongs. 
For example, if the original sequence is ATCGATCGATCGATCG and we have random samples like ATCGATCG, the algorithm cannot
tell if this piece goes at the beginning, middle, or end because the pattern ATCG is repeated everywhere.

I consider this similar to trying to solve a puzzle with many identical pieces and you cannot tell which identical piece goes where.
This way, because of this, you end up putting them in the wrong places.

Another problem is when sequences have very few different letters, like AAAAAAAAAA. 
In this case, every piece ends with AAA and starts with AAA, so the algorithm thinks everything overlaps with everything else, even when it should not.


Abother major issue I noticed is that the algorithm gives very inconsistent results. 
Sometimes it achieves 80% accuracy, other times only 0.3% accuracy, even when using the same code. 
This happens because the algorithm depends a lot  on finding a good starting sample that matches the beginning of the original sequence. 
When random sampling is lucky and creates a sample that starts from position 0, the algorithm works well. 
But when no sample starts from the beginning, the algorithm has to guess the best starting point.
It is sometimes choosing poorly and reconstructing from the middle of the sequence instead. 
This makes the entire reconstruction wrong from the start, leading to very low accuracy.
